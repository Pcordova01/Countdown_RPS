# rock_paper_scissors
I made a program that recreates the childhood game of rock paper scissors in the form of a command-line game. In this game, the player is competing against their "friend" over who gets to fly a space ship that they have just stumbled upon. Once one of them wins (best 2 out of 3), a launchdown sequence is initiated and either the player flys away, or the friend does. 

## What I learned
